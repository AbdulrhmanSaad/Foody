# Foody 🍽️  

Check out the **[Live Demo](http://foody.runasp.net/)** 🚀  

I've developed this project using **ASP.NET Core**, featuring a comprehensive set of functionalities to provide a seamless user experience. Below is an in-depth look at what I built:  
## 🔹 User Authentication & Authorization  
- Secure **user authentication** using **ASP.NET Identity**.  
- **Role-based access control** (Admins can manage products, orders, and users, while regular users can access their personal data and cart).  

## 🔹 Product & Category Management  
- Complete **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products and categories.  
- Products are linked to their respective categories, allowing dynamic creation and modification.  
- Integrated **validation & error handling** to ensure data consistency and application stability.  

## 🔹 Cart Management 🛒  
- Fully functional **shopping cart system** with options to **add, update, remove, and view** items.  
- The cart is automatically saved and linked to the user’s session for **continuity across logins**.  
- **Real-time updates** on item availability and total price calculations.  

## 🔹 Order Management  
- Tracks the **full lifecycle** of an order from creation to fulfillment.  
- Orders are linked to users and products, maintaining a detailed **order history**.  

## 🔹 Search & Filtering  
- Users can **filter products by category** for better navigation.  

## 🔹 Payment Integration 💳  
- **Secure Stripe payment integration** for seamless transactions at checkout.  

## 🔹 Additional Features  
- 📢 **User feedback & reviews** system.  
- 🎨 **Responsive design** using **Bootstrap**.  
- ⚙️ Built with **ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server**.
